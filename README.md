<strong>Hi ! I’m @ThomcodeFr</strong> 👋

After my Master Degree in Business and Marketing, I worked four years as a Recruitment Consultant.
During my free time, I love to learn about code. So, it was therefore natural to turn this nascent passion into a profession.

I am french 🇫🇷 developper (in professional retraining), student at Pop School (France) in Web and Mobile Development 🌱.

I’m currently learning HTML / CSS 3 / PHP / Boostrap / Git / Linux => 💞️
