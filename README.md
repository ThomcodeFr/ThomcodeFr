<strong>Hi ! I’m @ThomcodeFr</strong> 👋

After my Master Degree in Business and Marketing,  I worked for four years as a Recruitment Consultant.
During my free time, I love learning about coding. Therefore, it was obvious to make this nascent passion into a profession.

I am a French 🇫🇷 developper (training), student at Pop School (France) in Web and Mobile Development 🌱.

💞️ : I’m currently learning : HTML / CSS 3 / Boostrap / JavaScript / Vue.js PHP / Symfony / React / React-Native / Git / Linux
